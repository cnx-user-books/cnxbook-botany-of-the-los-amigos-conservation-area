      The Los Amigos Botany Databases have grown rapidly based on all
      collections that have been made in the Los Amigos area during
      2001-2003. Collectors include John Janovec, Fernando Cornejo, Piers
      Majestyk, Piher Maceda, and Pedro Centeno. Robin Foster and Hamilton
      Beltr√°n conducted preliminary studies at Los Amigos early in 2001.
      Their plant lists are maintained here in searchable format.

      The Los Amigos Plant Collections Database is now available for
      searching, with approximately <emphasis>2700 collection records</emphasis>, including
      vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens. We are in the process of
      adding many new collection records and integrating about <emphasis>4000 images</emphasis>
      from the Los Amigos Botany Project with specimen searches.   Databases
      are operated using a combination between Filemaker Pro, MS Access, and
      MSSQL.  Updates are made on a regular basis.

      We have entered into Phase II of the Los Amigos Botany Project, which
      involves continued exploration of the Los Amigos Conservation Area, a
      400,00 acre (140,000 hectare) wildland protected by a private
      conservation concession and management plan.  Phase II also involves
      the development a database of information about taxa of the Los Amigos
      flora. This includes general information and descriptive
      characteristics for the &gt;1000 species we have collected mostly from
      about 500 hectares of forest around the Los Amigos Biological Station.
      These &gt;1000 species represent about 130 families and 475 genera of
      plants. A database is being developed to handle character information
      and other information about families, genera, and species of the Los
      Amigos flora.

      We are also working with Dr. Bryan Heidorn of the University of
      Illinois Urbana-Champaign School of Library and Information Science to
      develop a web-based Los Amigos Botanical Information System that will
      provide new innovative search engine techniques and a collaborative
      working environment for continued documentation of plant diversity of
      Los Amigos, Madre de Dios, Peru, and the Andes-Amazon region of SE
      Peru in general.

	We will appreciate any comments, corrections, preliminary
	determinations we can get. This website is becoming part of the
	communication system between taxonomic experts and the Los Amigos
	Botany Project as we develop plant guides to the Los Amigos Biological
	Station and Conservation Area.

	Please search through your favorite families and view the images we
	have available. If you can help with preliminary names, name
	corrections, we will appreciate and acknowledge your input. And if you
	need herbarium specimens, images, or special collections of particular
	plants for morphological, anatomical, or molecular research, please
	contact us about cooperation and collaboration.  Please e-mail John
